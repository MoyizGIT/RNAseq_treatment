# RNAseq_treatment
This repository is created to implement an RNASEQ pipeline.
Here you will see the the type of data that can be treated.
First the pipeline will contain four steps which are :
1. ## Quality control with FASTQC
2. ## Read filtering with Cutadapt
3. ## Sequences mapping with STAR
4. ## Transcrits counts
